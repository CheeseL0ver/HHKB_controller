Rev.E Errata
============
2014/12/08


- *** Rev.E BT test *** - DONE
    - with MCP73832, new Schottky, tantalum caps - DONE 12/07
        * MCP73832 doesn't leak from Vcc pin when unpluged and battery powered
            34mV vs 2.07V(MCP73831) at Vcc pin
            MCP73832 doesn't need revese protection diode D5
        * PMEG2010ER is very low VF while reverse current/voltage is high
            VF=0.96 vs 1.98(RB160M-30TR)with Fluke 175
            Anode of D11 is 680mV vs 20mV(RB160M-30TR)
            780mV is still low < 1.4V VBUS plugin detection(21.11)
                this doesn't cause false VBUS detect
                and 780mV on MCP73832 Vcc pin is also no problem.
            D5 can be removed.
    - ADC divider switching - DONE 12/07
        * Drain and Source of Q4 Pch was reversed wrongly on Rev.E.

    - reverse current from Lipo charger - DONE 12/07
        * MCP73832 has no recverse current from Vcc pin unlike MCP73831


- Rev.F design - DONE
    - current measure point - DONE 12/08
    - change value of cap 68->47    - DONE 12/08
    - PPTC land pattern: no solder jumper, use 0Ohm resistor instead - CANCEL 12/08
    - Q4 Pch FET: wrong Drain and Source - DONE 12/08
    - D5 can be removed.    - DONE 12/08



Rev.E Fix
---------
Q4 Pch FET drain and source pins are reversed stupidly in schematic and PCB on this revision.
You need to solder the FET upside down like this, really shame.
