- Remove C13 pads
    DONE 2016/01(Rev.J)

- alternative connector to make component placement easy
    UX60SC-MB-5S8       whith through hole pins DONE 2015/12(Rev.I)

- Solder mask clearance
    - PCBway                0.15mm/0.075mm (0.1mm/0.050mm for green) DONE 2015/12(Rev.I)

- Logo
    - TMK logo

- Reduce components of BT part
    - use resistor array?
    - remove MOSFET

- Battery charger
    - reverse polarity protection of battery
    - connecting battery with reversed polarity definitely breaks charger chip even with a few seconds, it breaks in kindof short-circuit, fried chip may make battery fault in the end.
    - Bigger + and - marking on battery connector
    - Schottky diode between battery + and -. SS2040FL(2A/40V sod123) works for this.
