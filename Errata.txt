Rev.B Errata and TODO
=====================
2014/07/29  Done for Rev.C




PENDING: future revision
--------
- voltage shifter   -- Another revision PCB?    -- Pending
    using RS-232C driver is better? ussable for 5V-3.3V shifter?
    power consumption?(in comparison with MOSFET shifter)

- UVCC should be connected directly to VUSB? like as VBUS.  -- no harm. Pending
    UVCC is needed only when USB is plugged.
    But it seems to be no harm even if UVCC is powered when not plugged in.




DONE:
-----
- Change drill size of LED and switch to 1.0mm -- Done 07/29

- Placement of USB receptacle    --- move Top right hole 0.2mm to the right -- Done 07/29
    USB MiniB connector should be left to around 0.3mm
    And Top right hole size should be a bit smaller

- Battery cut-off of Lipo protect circuit   -- OK 07/03
    http://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/Li-poly%20085060-2400mAh.pdf
    Charge cut-off: 4.2V
    Discharge cut-off: 2.75V

- Xtal: too far from pins. may cause EMI problem. -- Done

- Inductor is too small? -- change footprint bigger. Done
    **With NCP1402 inductor(TOKO D63LCB 100uH) whines when step-up converter is working.
    NCP1402 needs 47uH instead of 100uH.
    Sumida 47uH(6x6mm, CDRH5D28NP) doesn't whine and very calm.(07/07)
    TODO: How about TOKO D63LCB 47uH? TOKO is very cheap while Sumida one is expensive(250yen).
          Need bigger one? Sumida CDRH6D38NP 7x7mm.

    NCP1402 uses Sumida CD54-470L 47uH 0.72A

    Datasheet of HT7750 uses ABC SR0602 inductor 47-100uH which has around Isat 0.75A-0.55A

- NCP1402 capacitor/inductor configuration -- changed values 07/03 Done
    47uH, 10uF/16V and 68uF/10V
    instead of HT7750

- schottky land pattern is too small for SOD123 -- Done 06/24
    NCP1402 uses MBR0520LT1 20V/0.5A SOD123
        Vf 0.38V
    RB521S-30   30V/0.2A                NG
    RB160M-30   30V/1A    SOD123        OK

- Capacitor polarity marking of dcdc converter -- Done 07/28
    NCP1402 may use tantalum

- R14,D7,D8 are removed -- remove from Schematic 07/03
    RN-42 LED_ACT

- R8,R9 values are reversed -- fix values on PCB 07/03
    voltage shifter 10k 15k

- RTS, CTS -- Done
    NOTE: PD5(CTS) is used as RTS and connected to CTS of RN-42. Confusing? YES.
    PD5: RTS->CTS
    PF1: CTS<-RTS
    *CTS of the module is needed to wake up from deep sleep.
- RN-42 GPIO6 for connection control    -- Done
    use PF7
    SM,4 Master mode can be controled with this port. This seems to be critical.

- Power selector doesn't work; Q4 MOSFET leaks from Lipo to USB power line. -- removed Q4 and added D11 07/03 --Done
    Schottky diode can solve simply at the expence of forward voltage drop.
    Q4 is on both USB and Lipo actually
    Q4 is on and leak when Lipo turns on; Vgs = Gnd(g) - Lipo(s)

- MCP73831  -- Done
    Add capacitor C16 on BAT  -- 07/03

- Jumper "No Lipo" remove -- 07/04  -- Done
    Not needed.

- Fix Ground fill of back side of USB receptacle -- 07/04   -- Done
    back side should be  filled

- Add JST PH-2 thourough hole pattern -- 07/04  -- Done
    JST PH-2 SMT is hard to find

- Remove ISP of RN-42 headers -- 07/04  -- Done



CANCELED:
--------
- Xtal: both TH and SMT components should be applied -- Cancel
    Not possible? bottom case touches SMT lands.

- ?current measure point should be closed by default?   -- Cancel
    YES.
    closed solder jumper cannot be created in KiCAD.

- 5V UART interface is preferable?  -- NO. 3.3V is better to connect with the module directly.
    3.3V RX_33 can not be shared between AVR and external serial adapter. -- R9 is too high and can not sink adapter hi output?

- RN-42 GPIO9 *optional     -- Not needed. iOS is not supported.(Apple authenticate co-processor is not available)
    to toggle virtual keyboard on iOS

- RN-42 GPIO11 *optional    -- Not needed. can be done with configuration
    to force HID profile

- Step-up converter(UVLO Under voltage lock out) -- misunderstood 07/04
    FACT: UVLO is a function to stop converting when charge source(not Lipo) gets to low voltage.
    FACT: Lipo has protection circuit for over discharge/charge
    NOT: HT7750A exhausts battery to voltage as 0.9V which is too low for Lipo.
    NOT: While other converter which works with Lipo UVLO is 2.1V. This is also still not save for Lipo.
    NOT: UVLO is not for Lipo protection? HT7750A should be used with normal dry battery.

- Battery LED controlled by firmware.   
    This can indicate 'charging' status when powered and 'low voltage alart' when battery drived.
    ~CHRG: Input: read charger state,  Hi-Z: LED off, Low: LED on
    LED takes power from PSEL line; powered from USB when avaialble or battery when USB is not available and switched.
    - probably need MCP73832 instead of MCP73831
      73831 has totem pole upper Pch FET on STAT(CHRG) output and LED current leaks through its body diode when not powered.
      The leaked current gives VBUS voltage around 1.5V and controller detects USB plug wrongly in the result.
    # schematic Done 09/07  powered from PSEL

- Dual color LED for battery/power status
    - connect red to charger status/controller and green to VUSB line/Gnd.

    - 3025 yellow/green LED http://akizukidenshi.com/catalog/g/gI-05678/
    # schematic 09/08

- Voltage divider switch is needed? its current consumption is critical?

- Solder jumpers to removing wireless function easily even if components are installed
    # Cancel 09/07     not needed on second thought

- Power control silk
    - box line around components

- Noise from boost converter
    Input capacitor 10uF causes whine sound. Removing the 10uF stops the noise.
    Tantalum 3528 one recuced a bit in comparison with ceramic one.
    With Taiyo Yuden iductor the noise seems to be reduced.
    # Use tantalum cap

    # CANCELED 10/30: HHKB users never mind LED indicators for lock keys.


PATCH for Rev.D PCB
===================
With Rev.D to implements Bluetooth components you better have these fixes. It will work whitout fixes but these will make battery life a little bit longer.

Charger leak Fix
----------------
Without this MCU is powered with leakage current of Lipo charger MCP73831 even when swich is off.

Cut trace which runs from 'NoPPTC' solder jumper to 'PPTC' and place schottky diode on 'PPTC' lands with direction presented in picture.

ADC Switch Fix
--------------
Without this MCU is powered through ADC pin from Lipo battery.
Place components as located in picture.
