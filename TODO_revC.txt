- PTC is used only for BT
    # schematic Done 09/07
    # Canceled
- Capacitor values of NCP1402 should be reversed: 10<->68uF
    # schematic Done 09/07
- Rprog of MCP charger: Rp instead of 10K value
    # schematic Done 09/07
- C2 is not needed
    # schematic Done 09/07
- remove solder jumpers as possible
    - leave through hole jumpers and cut power line to measure current
    # remove 5V amp measure
    # remove HHKB amp measure
    # remove 3.3V amp measure
    # schematic Done 09/07
- Battery LED controlled by firmware.   
    This can indicate 'charging' status when powered and 'low voltage alart' when battery drived.
    ~CHRG: Input: read charger state,  Hi-Z: LED off, Low: LED on
    LED takes power from PSEL line; powered from USB when avaialble or battery when USB is not available and switched.
    - probably need MCP73832 instead of MCP73831
      73831 has totem pole upper Pch FET on STAT(CHRG) output and LED current leaks through its body diode when not powered.
      The leaked current gives VBUS voltage around 1.5V and controller detects USB plug wrongly in the result.
    # schematic Done 09/07  powered from PSEL

- Dual color LED for battery/power status
    - connect red to charger status/controller and green to VUSB line/Gnd.
    - yellow/orange(red+green): charging(red drived by charger)
    - green:                    powered(full charged)
    - red:                      low voltage alart(drived by controller)
    - 3025 red/green LED    http://akizukidenshi.com/catalog/g/gI-02548/
    # module 09/07
    # schematic 09/08
- Dual color LED for BT status and indicator
    - green:                    BT status is connected to RN-42 GPIO5
    - yellow:                   indicator is controlled by firmware
    - 3025 yellow/green LED http://akizukidenshi.com/catalog/g/gI-05678/
    # schematic 09/08

- Voltage divider switch is needed? its current consumption is critical?

- Solder jumpers to removing wireless function easily even if components are installed
    # Cancel 09/07     not needed on second thought

- Power control silk
    - box line around components

- Noise from boost converter
    Input capacitor 10uF causes whine sound. Removing the 10uF stops the noise.
    Tantalum 3528 one recuced a bit in comparison with ceramic one.
    With Taiyo Yuden iductor the noise seems to be reduced.
    # Use tantalum cap

- No 16MHz silk

- D1 LED footprint revise

- Bivar LED light pipe
    - TH LED footprint drill size

- use PF4 to switch ADC voltage divider
    - with Nch MOS-FET

PENDING
-------
- UVCC should be connected directly to VUSB? like as VBUS.  -- no harm. Pending
    UVCC is needed only when USB is plugged.
    But it seems to be no harm even if UVCC is powered when not plugged in.
- MCU at 3.3V(or directly from Lipo)
    - Voltage shifter between MCU and switch board
    - 5V booster controlled by firmware
- 3.3V regulator controlled by firmware
    - use reglator with enable pin
    - power saving controlled by firmware
