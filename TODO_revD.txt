Rev.D Errata

- Light pipe position align
    - right one should be closer to edge
    - third LED and light pipe on middle between two?

- Loose light pipe hole
    - smaller holes for LEDs
    - check datasheet of light pipe again

- Power control of HHKB
    - pull up or down resistor? normally on or off?
    - difference in power consumption between them?
    
- MCP73832 test
    - charge LED is ok? should not light when not charging
    - power LED shoul not light when not powered(need schotky diode on vdd of charger?)

- Lipo voltage divider: leak current
    - Lipo -> R17 -> PF0, about 1.3V is supplied even when it turns off
    - high side FET switch is needed

- Idea: Solder jumper inside of PPTC and schotky diode
    - to save PCB space jumper can place between lands of the components
    - concern of an accidental short circuit?

- MCP73831 leak voltage? from Vdd when not powered
    - it will need a schotky diode there.
    - VBUS of ATMega32U4 pin fails to detect of USB plug in/off event
    - LTC4054 doesn't have this problem
    - schotky also resolves charge LED problem*

- MCP73831 charge LED dim lights up when not charging
    - MCP73832 has no upside MOSFET: may resolve this?
    - schotky diode on vdd of MCP73831 resolve this problem*

- Pull-down resistor of MOSFET switch instead of pull-up
    - for HHKB key switch board power control
    - good when power down mode
    - curretnt flows to IO port through pull-up is needed to disable switch(0.5mA wht 10KOhm pull-up)

- Paste layer for stencil
    need to add paste layers on modules

- UVCC should be connected directly to VUSB? like as VBUS.  -- no harm. Pending
    UVCC is needed only when USB is plugged.
    But it seems to be no harm even if UVCC is powered when not plugged in.

- extension pins output
    - in addition to PD0 and PD1 for external
    - other pins used for BT for internal?
    - PD6(LED), PC6,7(JP), PD2,3,4,5,PE6,PF0,1,4,5,6,7(BT)
    - and 5V, GND

- LED for non BT(USB controller)
    - using USB hub holes is preferable
    - for lock key and layer status
    - BT indicators can be used?


PATCH for Rev.D PCB
===================
With Rev.D to implements Bluetooth components you better have these fixes. It will work whitout fixes but these will make battery life a little bit longer.

Charger leak Fix
----------------
Without this MCU is powered with leakage current of Lipo charger MCP73831 even when swich is off.

Cut trace which runs from 'NoPPTC' solder jumper to 'PPTC' and place schottky diode on 'PPTC' lands with direction presented in picture.

ADC Switch Fix
--------------
Without this MCU is powered through ADC pin from Lipo battery.
Place components as located in picture.

PENDING
-------
- MCU at 3.3V(or directly from Lipo)
    - Voltage shifter between MCU and switch board
    - 5V booster controlled by firmware
- 3.3V regulator controlled by firmware
    - use reglator with enable pin
    - power saving controlled by firmware
- Xtal 8MHz
    - confirmed: USART doesn't work at baud rate 115200
    - default buad rate of RN-42 is 115200(factory setting)
    - power saving effect on MCU is not so drastic
